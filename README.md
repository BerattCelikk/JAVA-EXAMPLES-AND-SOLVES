## 📖 Project Overview

The **JavaCore Laboratory** is a specialized repository hosting a diverse range of Java programming examples, enterprise-level design patterns, and complex algorithmic solves. Developed as a core technical asset of the **Codiom** initiative, this project demonstrates a commitment to writing type-safe, maintainable, and highly scalable software.

As a Software Engineering student at Istanbul Aydın University, I utilize this repository to master the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem—focusing on memory management, multithreading, and the powerful Java Collections Framework.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🎭 Deep OOP Principles:** Comprehensive implementation of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism in an enterprise context.
* **🛠️ Java Collections Framework:** Optimized use of `List`, `Set`, `Map`, and `Queue` for high-performance data manipulation.
* **⚡ Exception Handling:** Implementation of robust error-handling strategies using try-catch-finally and custom exceptions.
* **🧩 Streams API & Lambdas:** Utilizing modern Java (8+) features for functional programming and efficient data processing.
* **💾 JVM & Memory Management:** Understanding heap/stack allocation and garbage collection through rigorous code optimization.
* **🔍 Generics & Type Safety:** Implementing reusable, type-safe components to minimize runtime errors.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Language**| **Java (11/17+)** | Core system development and enterprise logic. |
| **Build Tools** | **Maven / Gradle** | Managing project dependencies and build lifecycles. |
| **Runtime** | **JVM** | High-performance execution and memory management. |
| **IDE** | **IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse**| Professional development and debugging environments. |
| **Testing** | **JUnit 5** | Automated unit testing and validation of logic. |

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The repository follows standard Java package conventions, ensuring that architectural components are modular and easy to navigate.



### Efficiency & Scalability
Every algorithmic solution is analyzed for its computational impact:

* **Big O Complexity:** Solutions are benchmarked to achieve optimal $O(n \log n)$ or $O(n)$ performance.
* **Thread Safety:** Implementation of concurrent structures where parallel processing is required.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or higher) installed:
```bash
java -version

```

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/BerattCelikk/JAVA-EXAMPLES-AND-SOLVES.git](https://github.com/BerattCelikk/JAVA-EXAMPLES-AND-SOLVES.git)
cd JAVA-EXAMPLES-AND-SOLVES
```

### 3. Build & Run
Using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install
java -cp target/java-examples-1.0.jar com.codiom.Main

```
To generate the Kaggle submission file:
```bash
python submission.py
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Spring Boot Integration: Developing microservices examples using the Spring ecosystem.
- [ ] Design Patterns: Adding implementations for Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns.
- [ ] Hibernate & JPA: Integrating database persistence and ORM examples.
- [ ] Dockerization: Containerizing Java applications for cloud-native deployment.
